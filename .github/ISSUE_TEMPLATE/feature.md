### What's the idea?

<!-- describe your idea in one or two sentences -->
I think it would be cool to have a _something function_ that can draw _something_.

**Code**
<!-- add a code snippet that shows how you want to use the new feature -->
```python
# your code in here
```

**Output**
<!-- show the expected render result if possible -->
```
# render result in here
```
