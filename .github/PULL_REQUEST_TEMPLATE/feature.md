### What's the idea?

<!-- describe your idea in one or two sentences -->
I think it would be cool to have a _something function_ that can draw _something_.

**Code**
<!-- add a code snippet that shows how you want to use the new feature -->
```python
# your code in here
```

**Output**
<!-- show the expected render result if possible -->
```
# render result in here
```

<!-- You can simply copy everything upto this point from the related issue if it exists. -->

### How did I accomplish this?

<!-- describe your implementation in one or two sentences -->
I added the _something function_ which can draw _something_ using the _something algorithm_ I found at _the source of all somethings_.

**Code**
<!-- add a code snippet that shows how you want to use the new feature -->
```python
# your code in here
```

**Output**
<!-- show the expected render result if possible -->
```
# render result in here
```

<!-- The last two parts are only required if the interface/output of your implemenation is different from what was requested. -->
